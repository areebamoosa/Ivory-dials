# ⌚ Ivory Dials

An online e-commerce platform for showcasing timeless designs with a clean & smooth product browsing.

## About this project 🚀

Ivory Dials is a watch store website built entirely from scratch as an original project idea. The main focus of this project was to practice and strengthen my **Tailwind CSS skills** while creating a polished, real-world style interface.

Building this project helped me gain confidence in using Tailwind utility classes effectively and translating a design idea into a functional web experience.
